Alright so, the title of the website is "JWT Auth Demo" and this is our first hint into what will be going on in this login page

The actual websit page allows users to enter a username to login and provides a JWT "Json Web Token" token to the user that is stored in local storage
this allows users to modify their own token and authenticate themselves. After login in as "admin" this is what the website looks like
